  Lab: HTML Drills</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Objective: Implement and practice the use of HTML elements and attributes.</h1>
<p>Create an index.html file, insert the basic elements needed to start an html file, this will include a doctype, html element, head element, and body element.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hint: There is a keyboard shortcut in VS Code to complete this! Try researching emmet abbreviations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inside the <body> of your page, insert <h1> through <h6> elements, give each heading element some funny text. These will represent "sections" of the lab.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Add a comment before each heading to give yourself a reminder of what the purpose of that section should be.</p>
<p>Insert a paragraph element after each heading. Inside each <p>, write a little bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Add an image after each paragraph on your page.</p>
<p>"Wrap" each section (heading, paragraph, and image) with a <section> tag. The open section tag should precede the first heading tag, and the closing section tag should be after the image tag. Remember to indent properly!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hint: if your indentation ever gets out of whack, just right-click anywhere in VS Code and click "Format Document"!</p>
<p>Between every paragraph and image, create an unordered list with at least three list items. Again, the content contained in this list is up to you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Create a form with 3 inputs for first name, last name, and email address. Make sure each input is labeled, and that all of them (not each individually) are wrapped with a form tag.</p>
<p>Add a button to the form using an input tag.</p>
<p>Hint: You may need to google input type submit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Create an ordered list, give the list at least 5 list items of things you're excited to learn about in Covalence.</p>
<p>Create an unordered list, give this list at least 5 interesting facts about yourself.</p>
<p>Wrap the entire page in a <div>.</p>
<p>*   **Hint**: UI elements can only be placed within the `<body>`.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reformat the document. How does it change compared to what you had originally written?</p>
<p>*   **Hint**: You can use `CMD + Z` to undo and `CMD + SHIFT + Z` to redo on a Mac. On Windows it is `CTRL + Z` to undo and `CTRL + Y` to redo.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Add a horizontal line between each section in your document.</p>
<p>Add hyperlinks to each image that opens the image in a new tab.</p>
<p>At the top of your page, create a table with the following columns (headers): Month, Day, Year.</p>
<p>Add a row for each day that you worked on these tasks.</p>
<p>Add an anchor tag, have this link to a funny YouTube video.</p>
<p>Add a horizontal line. Below the line add a div.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inside the div add an <h1> tag, and give the header the text of the name of your favorite movie.</p>
<p>Insert an img tag of the movie poster.</p>
<p>Add a paragraph element below the heading, have this be a description/plot of the movie (NO SPOILERS).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Add an unordered list with the cast of the movie.</p>
<p>Add another unordered list with release date, budget and box office sale stats.</p>
<p>Embed a trailer of the film using YouTube.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Wow! That was a lot of HTML! If you survived that, you should have a pretty good grasp of how elements work and how they nest with each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember, HTML alone can't make a page very pretty. We have to also style the page with CSS, so let's keep going!</p>
